# No Data Deletion Rule

**NEVER** delete data from any database without explicit user confirmation. This includes:

## Protected Data Sources

1. **Vector Databases (Qdrant, Pinecone, etc.)**
   - Do NOT use `--recreate` flags
   - Do NOT delete collections
   - Do NOT run bulk delete operations
   - Do NOT use `deleteByFilter` or similar methods

2. **SQL/SQLite Databases**
   - Do NOT truncate tables
   - Do NOT drop tables
   - Do NOT run DELETE statements without WHERE clauses
   - Do NOT run migrations that drop columns/tables without confirmation

3. **External APIs and Services**
   - Do NOT delete resources via API calls
   - Do NOT overwrite existing data without confirmation

## Before Any Destructive Operation

**ALWAYS** ask the user for explicit confirmation before:
- Deleting any records
- Recreating collections or tables
- Running migrations that modify existing data
- Syncing data that might overwrite existing entries
- Using any flag like `--fresh`, `--recreate`, `--force-delete`

## Safe Alternatives

Instead of deleting, prefer:
- **Adding** new data alongside existing data
- **Updating** specific records
- **Creating backups** before modifications
- **Using soft deletes** when available

## Example Violations

```bash
# NEVER run without asking first:
php artisan tariff:sync-vectors --recreate  # Deletes collection!
php artisan migrate:fresh                    # Drops all tables!
php artisan db:wipe                          # Wipes database!
```

## When User Requests Deletion

If the user explicitly asks to delete data:
1. Confirm what will be deleted
2. Ask if they have a backup
3. Warn about irreversibility
4. Only proceed after explicit "yes" confirmation
